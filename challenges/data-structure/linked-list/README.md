# Challenge Summary
To create a linked-list with four methods which are .insert(value), includes(value),toString(value),.append(value),.insertBefore(value, newVal), .insertAfter(value, newVal).

## Challenge Description
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

*Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
* Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a Boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
* Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

* .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency
for .insert(value)
O(1)
for includes(value),toString(value), .append(value), insertBefore(value, newVal), .insertAfter(value, newVal)
O(n)
